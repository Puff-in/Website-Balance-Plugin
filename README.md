Once the plugin is running, you can update a user's Shop Balance with a simple command.

1.  **Update Permissions:**
    -   Go to your `permissions` table in the database.
    -   Find the `cmd_addwebsitebalance` permission and set its value to `1` for the ranks you want to have access to this command.
    -   Run the `:update_permissions` command in your client to apply the changes.

2.  **Command Execution:**
